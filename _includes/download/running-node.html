                    <h3>Running a node</h3>
                    <p>When you run your node, it will execute Koi Tasks, which help us build the public knowledge archive. Youâ€™ll earn KOI rewards for every task completed, plus you can also stake the tokens you earn to get more!</p>
                    <p>Building public information systems makes the internet more transparent, and helps provide an unbiased source of truth in our confusing world.</p>
